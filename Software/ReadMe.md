# Node-Red LED Strip Controller Software

# Summary

As discussed throughout this project the LED Strip Controller is a microcontroller based device running its own firmware which can be communicated with using USB Serial. For anyone to interact with the hardware they must either abide by the serial control interface or use one of the following software approaches.

# Software Interactions
A variety of different software applications were created/used to interact with the hardware.

## Python Command Interface
At the simplest a Python Control Interface was developed which would connect to the hardware and ask the user a series of questions as to what they wanted each channel to do.

## Node-Red 
The next application was Node-Red which was responsible for interacting with Alexa and acting as a gateway between the Alexa and the hardware control system.
