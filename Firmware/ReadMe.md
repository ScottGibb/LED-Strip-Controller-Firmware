# LED Strip Controller Firmware

The LED Strip firmware is written using the Arduino framework. This allowed for a higher abstraction level achieved as well as STM32 clones to be used. A such a C++ Object orientated design was taken. Resulting in a set of Drivers and Handlers. The Resulting Firmware layers are shown below:
